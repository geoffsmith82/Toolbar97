# Toolbar97
This is an updated version of Toolbar97 that you can download from https://jrsoftware.org/tb97dl.php 
## Why have I done this?
I have updated it so that it can be installed in Delphi Sydney 10.4, including 64-bit Windows. This will assist people porting old apps to new versions of Delphi.
There is not to many changes required for the 32-bit version to compile for the 32-bit version of windows.  The 64-bit required some more changes because of the different pointer size.

I haven't tested this very much and it wont support some of the latest features - Styles, hDPI, etc - but it will allow you to compile old projects with probably no code changes (at least for the Toolbar97 part).


Thanks

Geoffrey Smith
